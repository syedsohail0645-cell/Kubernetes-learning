What are pods ?
Pods are the smalled unit in kubernetes which is used to deploy a container. Which provide high abstraction over a resource 

What are controllers?
Controller's keep's our app running in the desired state of the pod . Starting and stopping of the application and autoscaling check's deployment state 

What are static pod's?
BAsically static pods are something that are managed by kubectl node. A static pod runs because it's Yaml file exist on the node in the location called (/etc/kubernetes/manifest)
No deployment or Replicat set or scheduler. Kubectl watches the file and ensure the pod is always running . If the pod craches or the file is changed kubectl restart. Update it 

/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

What is a Multi-Container Pod?

A multi-container pod is a Kubernetes pod that runs more than one container inside the same pod.

👉 All containers in a pod:

Share the same IP address

Share the same network namespace

Can share volumes

Are scheduled together on the same node

Think of it as containers that must live and work together.

Why are multi-container pods used?

They’re used when containers are tightly coupled and depend on each other.

Common reasons:

1️⃣ One container supports another
2️⃣ They need shared storage
3️⃣ They must communicate via localhost
4️⃣ They should be scaled and deployed together

Common Multi-Container Pod Patterns
1️⃣ Sidecar pattern (most common ⭐)

One main app container + one helper container

Example:

App container → writes logs

Sidecar container → reads logs and ships them to ELK

App Container  ---> /logs (shared volume)
Sidecar        ---> sends logs

2️⃣ Ambassador pattern

A helper container handles network communication.

Example:

App talks to localhost

Ambassador handles auth / TLS / retries

3️⃣ Adapter pattern

Converts output into a standard format.

Example:

App produces logs in custom format

Adapter converts logs to JSON

Simple YAML Example (Sidecar)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx

    - name: sidecar
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/nginx

What’s happening here?

Nginx writes logs

Sidecar reads logs from the same volume

Both containers share the pod lifecycle

When NOT to use multi-container pods ❌

If containers can run independently

If they need separate scaling

If they don’t strongly depend on each other

Interview one-liner 🎯

A multi-container pod runs multiple tightly coupled containers that share networking and storage, commonly used for sidecar, ambassador, or adapter patterns.
