1️⃣ Pod Lifecycle (From Birth to Death)

A Pod lifecycle is the journey of a pod from creation → running → termination.

Pod Phases

You can see pod phase using:

kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o wide

Main Pod Phases
🔹 Pending

Pod is accepted by Kubernetes

Containers are not running yet

Reasons:

Image pull in progress

Node not available

PVC not bound

🔹 Running

Pod is scheduled to a node

Containers are created

At least one container is running

🔹 Succeeded

All containers finished successfully

Common in Jobs / CronJobs

🔹 Failed

One or more containers exited with failure

Exit code ≠ 0

🔹 Unknown

Kubelet cannot communicate with node

Rare but possible

2️⃣ Pod Stopping & Termination (Very Important)

Pods are not killed immediately.

What happens when a pod is terminated?

Triggered by:

kubectl delete pod

Deployment update

Node shutdown

Auto-scaling

Termination Flow (Step-by-step)
Step 1: Pod enters Terminating state
kubectl get pods

Step 2: SIGTERM is sent to containers

Kubernetes sends SIGTERM

App should gracefully shut down

Example:

Stop accepting new requests

Finish ongoing requests

Close DB connections

Step 3: Grace period starts (default 30s)
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30


App has this time to exit cleanly.

Step 4: SIGKILL (if not exited)

If app doesn’t stop within grace period

Kubernetes sends SIGKILL

Container is force killed

Example Pod with Grace Period
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: graceful-pod
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx

3️⃣ PreStop Hook (Clean Shutdown)

You can run logic before SIGTERM.

Example
lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 10"]


Use cases:

Drain traffic

Notify other services

Flush logs
