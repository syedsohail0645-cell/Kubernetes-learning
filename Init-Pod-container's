What are Init Containers?

Init containers are special containers that run before the main application containers in a pod.

👉 They are mainly used to:

Do setup tasks

Check dependencies

Prepare configuration or data

Only after init containers finish successfully, the main app containers start.

How Init Containers work (flow)

1️⃣ Pod is created
2️⃣ Init container starts
3️⃣ Init container completes its task and exits successfully
4️⃣ Main application container starts
5️⃣ If init container fails → pod stays in Init state and retries

📌 Init containers run sequentially, one after another.

Simple Example (Wait for a Service)
Scenario

Your app should start only after a database is ready.

Pod YAML with Init Container
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-demo
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: wait-for-db
      image: busybox
      command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - |
          until nc -z mysql 3306; do
            echo "Waiting for database..."
            sleep 5
          done
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80

What happens here?

wait-for-db runs first

It keeps checking if MySQL on port 3306 is reachable

Once MySQL is available → init container exits

Nginx container starts

Key differences vs normal containers
Init Container	App Container
Runs before app	Runs continuously
Must complete	Keeps running
Can fail & retry	Restarted on crash
Used for setup	Used for serving traffic
Real-world use cases

Waiting for DB / API / DNS

Downloading config or secrets

Setting file permissions

Running DB migrations
