1️⃣ What does “Pod Health” mean?

Kubernetes doesn’t guess if your app is healthy.
It uses probes to actively check the container’s health.

👉 Probes tell Kubernetes:

Is the app running correctly?

Should traffic be sent to it?

Should it be restarted?

2️⃣ Types of Health Probes

Kubernetes has three probes:

Liveness Probe

Readiness Probe

Startup Probe

Each has a different purpose.

3️⃣ Liveness Probe (Is the app stuck?)
What it checks

👉 Is the application still alive and responsive?

If liveness probe fails repeatedly:
➡ Kubernetes restarts the container.

When to use

App can hang or deadlock

Memory leaks

App is running but not responding

Example (HTTP)
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10


If /health returns non-200, container is restarted.

Real-life example

App is running but thread is stuck → liveness fails → container restarted → app recovers.

4️⃣ Readiness Probe (Can it receive traffic?)
What it checks

👉 Is the app ready to serve requests right now?

If readiness probe fails:
➡ Pod is removed from Service endpoints
➡ No restart happens

When to use

App is warming up

DB connection not ready

Cache not loaded

Example
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5


If readiness fails:

Traffic stops

Pod stays running

Real-life example

DB goes down → readiness fails → pod stops receiving traffic → users don’t see errors.

5️⃣ Startup Probe (Has the app started?)
Why it exists

Some apps start very slowly.
Liveness probe might kill them before startup completes.

Startup probe tells Kubernetes:
👉 Wait until startup is complete before applying liveness checks.

How it works

Startup probe runs first

Once it succeeds:

Startup probe stops

Liveness & readiness start

Example
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10


This gives the app:
👉 30 × 10 = 300 seconds to start.

6️⃣ Full Example (All Probes Together)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: probe-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

      startupProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 8080
        failureThreshold: 30
        periodSeconds: 10

      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 8080
        periodSeconds: 10

      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /ready
          port: 8080
        periodSeconds: 5

7️⃣ What happens internally (Flow)
Container starts
   ↓
Startup Probe checks
   ↓
Startup successful
   ↓
Readiness Probe (traffic control)
   ↓
Liveness Probe (restart control)

8️⃣ Key Differences (Very Important)
Probe	Purpose	Failure Result
Startup	App started?	Container killed if exceeded
Readiness	Can serve traffic?	Removed from service
Liveness	App alive?	Container restarted
9️⃣ Interview one-liners 🎯

Liveness: Restarts stuck containers

Readiness: Controls traffic flow

Startup: Protects slow-starting apps

Kubernetes uses probes to determine container health, readiness to receive traffic, and when to restart applications safely.
